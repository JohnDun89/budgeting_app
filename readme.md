Brief
=====

MoneyCashboard

You want to start tracking your spending in an attempt to be more frugal with money. You have decided to make a budgeting app to help you see where all of your money is being spent.

You must be able to create new Transactions ( which should include a merchant name, e.g. Tesco, and a value ) which have an associated Tag (e.g. 'food', 'clothes'). Your app would then be able to track a total, and display this in a view.

MVP:

- Create new transactions
- Display a list of all transactions
- Display total amount spent
- Display total amount spent by tag
